          | About Me
      p
        | I'm a professional IT Systems Engineer currently working at Fraunhofer FIT.
        | My journey so far took me through automation management with Ansible.
        | I've seen a lot of YAML by now and I guess it will get a lot more.
        | Working with containers became an obsession and Kubernetes played a big role in it.
        | I like programming on APIs and all sorts of CLI tooling primarily in Go.
      p
        | Recently I decided to start working on my bachelors degree in computer science.
      p
        | Besides that I'm a real sports enthusiast.
        | I felt for martial-arts over 10 years ago and can't stop spending my free time on it.
